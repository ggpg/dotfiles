# dotfiles
Because installing things is rarely fun

## Colors
for the amber look on ubuntu, #FFB000 and #FFCC00

## Installation and usage on a new machine

### Pure ubuntu

*NEVER* run scripts directly from the internets. So,

```
git clone https://github.com/unamatasanatarai/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install
```

## Vim stuff
`<Leader>nu` will toggle numbers, cause sometimes you want to copy and paste with your mouse

`,w` is now `:w<CR>
