# dotfiles
Because installing things is rarely fun

## Compiling a new script
Make changes only in the source files located in `/src` folder.

Then recompile by running:
./src/make_ubuntu.sh

## Installation and usage on a new machine
NEVER run scripts directly from the internets. So, 

```
wget 
./ubuntu.sh
```
